**mux** (Coding Agent Multiplexer) is a cross-platform desktop application for AI-assisted development with isolated workspace management.

## What is mux?

mux helps you work with multiple coding assistants more effectively via:

- Isolated workspaces with central view on git status updates
- Multi-model (`sonnet-4-*`, `grok-*`, `gpt-5-*`, `opus-4-*`) support
- Supporting UI and keybinds for efficiently managing a suite of agents
- Rich markdown outputs (mermaid diagrams, LaTeX, etc.)
