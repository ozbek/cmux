title: AGENTS.md
description: Agent instructions for AI assistants working on the mux codebase
---

**Prime directive:** keep edits minimal and token-efficient—say only what conveys actionable signal.

## Project Snapshot

- `mux`: Electron + React desktop app for parallel agent workflows; UX must be fast, responsive, predictable.
- Minor breaking changes are expected, but critical flows must allow upgrade↔downgrade without friction; skip migrations when breakage is tightly scoped.
- Public work (issues/PRs/commits) must use 🤖 in the title and include "_Generated with `mux`_" in the body when applicable.

## PR + Release Workflow

- Reuse existing PRs; never close or recreate without instruction. Force-push updates.
- After every push run:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus | jq '.'
./scripts/wait_pr_checks.sh <pr_number>
```

- Generally run `wait_pr_checks` after submitting a PR to ensure CI passes.
- Status decoding: `mergeable=MERGEABLE` clean; `CONFLICTING` needs resolution. `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN` ready, `BLOCKED` waiting for CI, `BEHIND` rebase, `DIRTY` conflicts.
- If behind: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`.
- Never enable auto-merge or merge at all unless the user explicitly says "merge it".
- Do not enable auto-squash or auto-merge on Pull Requests unless explicit permission is given.
- PR descriptions: include only information a busy reviewer cannot infer; focus on implementation nuances or validation steps.
- Title prefixes: `perf|refactor|fix|feat|ci|bench`, e.g., `🤖 fix: handle workspace rename edge cases`.

## Repo Reference

- Core files: `src/main.ts`, `src/preload.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/config.ts`.
- Persistent data: `~/.mux/config.json`, `~/.mux/src/<project>/<branch>` (worktrees), `~/.mux/sessions/<workspace>/chat.jsonl`.

## Documentation Rules

- No free-floating Markdown. User docs live in `docs/` (read `docs/README.md`, add pages to `docs.json` navigation, use standard Markdown + mermaid). Developer/test notes belong inline as comments.
- For planning artifacts, use the `propose_plan` tool or inline comments instead of ad-hoc docs.
- Do not add new root-level docs without explicit request; during feature work rely on code + tests + inline comments.
- Test documentation stays inside the relevant test file as commentary explaining setup/edge cases.
- External API docs already live inside `/tmp/ai-sdk-docs/**.mdx`; never browse `https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core` directly.

## Key Features & Performance

- Core UX: projects sidebar (left panel), workspace management (local git worktrees or SSH clones), config stored in `~/.mux/config.json`.
- Fetch bulk data in one IPC call—no O(n) frontend→backend loops.

## Tooling & Commands

- Package manager: bun only. Use `bun install`, `bun add`, `bun run` (which proxies to Make when relevant). Run `bun install` if modules/types go missing.
- Makefile is source of truth (new commands land there, not `package.json`).
- Primary targets: `make dev|start|build|lint|lint-fix|fmt|fmt-check|typecheck|test|test-integration|clean|help`.
- Full `static-check` includes docs link checking via `mintlify broken-links`.

## Refactoring & Runtime Etiquette

- Use `git mv` to retain history when moving files.
- Never kill the running mux process; rely on `make test` / `make typecheck` for validation.

## Testing Doctrine

Two types of tests are preferred:

1. **True integration tests** — use real runtimes, real filesystems, real network calls. No mocks, stubs, or fakes. These prove the system works end-to-end.
2. **Unit tests on pure/isolated logic** — test pure functions or well-isolated modules where inputs and outputs are clear. No mocks needed because the code has no external dependencies.

Avoid mock-heavy tests that verify implementation details rather than behavior. If you need mocks to test something, consider whether the code should be restructured to be more testable.

### Storybook

- Prefer full-app stories (`App.stories.tsx`) to isolated components.

### TDD Expectations

- When asked for TDD, write real repo tests (no `/tmp` scripts) and commit them.
- Pull complex logic into easily tested utils. Target broad coverage with minimal cases that prove the feature matters.

### General Rules

- Always run `make typecheck` after changes (covers main + renderer).
- Place unit tests beside implementation (`*.test.ts`). Reserve `tests/` for heavy integration/E2E cases.
- Run unit suites with `bun test path/to/file.test.ts`.
- Skip tautological tests (simple mappings, identical copies of implementation); focus on invariants and boundary failures.
- Keep utils pure or parameterize external effects for easier testing.

### Integration Testing

- Use `bun x jest` (optionally `TEST_INTEGRATION=1`). Examples:
  - `TEST_INTEGRATION=1 bun x jest tests/integration/sendMessage.test.ts -t "pattern"`
  - `TEST_INTEGRATION=1 bun x jest tests`
- `tests/integration` is slow; filter with `-t` when possible. Tests use `test.concurrent()`.
- Never bypass IPC: do not call `env.config.saveConfig`, `env.historyService`, etc., directly. Use `env.mockIpcRenderer.invoke(IPC_CHANNELS.CONFIG_SAVE|HISTORY_GET|WORKSPACE_CREATE, ...)` instead.
- Acceptable exceptions: reading config to craft IPC args, verifying filesystem after IPC completes, or loading existing data to avoid redundant API calls.

## Command Palette & UI Access

- Open palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (win/linux); quick toggle via `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`.
- Palette covers workspace mgmt, navigation, chat utils, mode/model switches, slash commands (`/` for suggestions, `>` for actions).

## Styling

- Colors defined in `src/styles/colors.tsx`; fonts in `src/styles/fonts.tsx`. Reference them via CSS variables (e.g., `var(--color-plan-mode)`), never hardcode values.

## TypeScript Discipline

- Ban `as any`; rely on discriminated unions, type guards, or authored interfaces.
- Use `Record<Enum, Value>` for exhaustive mappings to catch missing cases.
- Apply utility types (`Omit`, `Pick`, etc.) to build UI-specific variants of backend types, preventing unnecessary re-renders and clarifying intent.
- Let types drive design: prefer discriminated unions for state, minimize runtime checks, and simplify when types feel unwieldy.
- Use `using` declarations (or equivalent disposables) for processes, file handles, etc., to ensure cleanup even on errors.
- Centralize magic constants under `src/constants/`; share them instead of duplicating values across layers.
- Never repeat constant values (like keybinds) in comments—they become stale when the constant changes.

## Component State & Storage

- Parent components own localStorage interactions; children announce intent only.
- Use `usePersistedState`/`readPersistedState`/`updatePersistedState` helpers—never call `localStorage` directly.
- Avoid destructuring props in function signatures; access via `props.field` to keep rename-friendly code.

## Module Imports

- Use static `import` statements at the top; resolve circular dependencies by extracting shared modules, inverting dependencies, or using DI. Dynamic `await import()` is not an acceptable workaround.

## Workspace Identity

- Frontend must never synthesize workspace IDs (e.g., `${project}-${branch}` is forbidden). Backend operations that change IDs must return the value; always consume that response.

## IPC Type Boundary

1. IPC methods return backend types (`WorkspaceMetadata`, etc.), not ad-hoc objects.
2. Frontend may extend backend types with UI context (projectPath, branch, etc.).
3. Frontend constructs UI shapes from backend responses plus existing context (e.g., recommended trunk branch).
4. Never duplicate type definitions around the boundary—import shared types instead.

**Why:** single source of truth, clean separation, automatic propagation of backend changes, and no duplicate schemas.

## Debugging & Diagnostics

- `bun run debug ui-messages --workspace <name>` to inspect messages; add `--drop <n>` to skip recent entries. Workspace names live in `~/.mux/sessions/`.

## UX Guardrails

- Do not add UX flourishes (auto-dismiss, animations, tooltips, etc.) unless requested. Ship the simplest behavior that meets requirements.
- Enforce DRY: if you repeat code/strings, factor a shared helper/constant (search first; if cross-layer, move to `src/constants/` or `src/types/`).
- Hooks that detect a condition should handle it directly when they already have the data—avoid unnecessary callback hop chains.
- Every operation must have a keyboard shortcut, and UI controls with shortcuts should surface them in hover tooltips.

## Logging

- Use the `log` helper (`log.debug` for noisy output) for backend logging.

## Bug-Fixing Mindset

- Prefer fixes that simplify existing code; such simplifications often do not need new tests.
- When adding complexity, add or extend tests. If coverage requires new infrastructure, propose the harness and then add the tests there.

## Mode: Exec

- Treat as a standing order: keep running checks and addressing failures until they pass or a blocker outside your control arises.
- **Before pushing to a PR**, run `make static-check` locally and ensure all checks pass. Fix issues with `make fmt` or manual edits. Never push until local checks are green.
- Reproduce remote static-check failures locally with `make static-check`; fix formatting with `make fmt` before rerunning CI.
- When CI fails, reproduce locally with the smallest relevant command; log approximate runtimes to optimize future loops.

## Mode: Plan

- When Plan Mode is requested, assume the user wants the actual completed plan; do not merely describe how you would devise one.
- Attach a net LoC estimate (product code only) to each recommended approach.

## Tool: status_set

- Set status url to the Pull Request once opened
