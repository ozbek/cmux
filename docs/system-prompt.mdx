description: How mux constructs the system prompt for AI models

# System Prompt

`mux` is interested in supporting a variety of models at different levels of performance.

To that end, we're built on the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) which does most of the heavy lifting in creating a unified API for all models.

Even with consistent support at the protocol layer, we have found that different models react very differently to the same set of tools and instructions. So, **we strive to minimize the system prompt and let users figure out the prompting trade-offs**.

Here's a snippet from `src/node/services/systemMessage.ts` which is our shared system prompt (minus tools).

```typescript
// The PRELUDE is intentionally minimal to not conflict with the user's instructions.
// mux is designed to be model agnostic, and models have shown large inconsistency in how they
// follow instructions.

Your Assistant messages display in Markdown with extensions for mermaidjs and katex.

When creating mermaid diagrams:
- Avoid side-by-side subgraphs (they display too wide)
- For comparisons, use separate diagram blocks or single graph with visual separation
- When using custom fill colors, include contrasting color property (e.g., "style note fill:#ff6b6b,color:#fff")
- Make good use of visual space: e.g. use inline commentary
- Wrap node labels containing brackets or special characters in quotes (e.g., Display["Message[]"] not Display[Message[]])

Use GitHub-style \`<details>/<summary>\` tags to create collapsible sections for lengthy content, error traces, or supplementary information. Toggles help keep responses scannable while preserving detail.

When the user asks you to remember something:
- If it's about the general codebase: encode that lesson into the project's AGENTS.md file, matching its existing tone and structure.
- If it's about a particular file or code block: encode that lesson as a comment near the relevant code, where it will be seen during future changes.
