description: Pair mux workspaces with VS Code and Cursor editors
---

The mux VS Code extension allows you to easily pair with mux during development. Our extension works with VS Code and Cursor.

It's especially useful for completing the "last mile" of a task or establishing the initial architecture.

## Overview

The extension has a small initial surface area: a command to open a workspace.

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Type "mux: Open Workspace"
   - Optional: Set a custom keybinding in the Command Palette settings
3. Select your workspace
4. It opens in a new editor window

The extension works with both local and SSH workspaces.

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest `.vsix` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/coder/mux/releases).

### Install

**Command line:**

```bash
# For VS Code
code --install-extension mux-*.vsix

# For Cursor
cursor --install-extension mux-*.vsix
```

**From editor UI:**

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the downloaded file

### Workspace Types

The extension displays workspaces differently based on their type:

- **Local**: `📁 [project-name] workspace-name`
- **SSH**: `🔗 [project-name] workspace-name (ssh: hostname)`

## SSH Workspaces

### Requirements

For SSH workspaces to work, you need:

1. **Remote-SSH Extension** installed
   - VS Code: `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh`
   - Cursor: `anysphere.remote-ssh`
   - The extension automatically detects which one you have
2. **SSH host configured** in `~/.ssh/config` or in the Remote-SSH extension

### Setup SSH Host

If you haven't configured the SSH host yet:

1. Open `~/.ssh/config` and add:

   ```bash
   Host myserver
     HostName 192.168.1.100
     User username
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. Or use VS Code's Remote-SSH command:
   - `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host..."

## Development

For development instructions, see `vscode/README.md` and `vscode/DEVELOPMENT.md` in the
repository.
