## Overview

Agent Skills are reusable, file-based “playbooks” that you can share across projects or keep project-local.

Mux follows the Agent Skills specification and exposes skills to models in two steps:

1. **Index in the system prompt**: mux lists available skills (name + description).
2. **Tool-based loading**: the agent calls tools to load a full skill when needed.

This keeps the system prompt small while still making skills discoverable.

## Where skills live

Mux discovers skills from two roots:

- **Project-local**: `<projectRoot>/.mux/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Global**: `~/.mux/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

If a skill exists in both locations, **project-local overrides global**.

<Info>
  Mux reads skills using the active workspace runtime. For SSH workspaces, skills are read from the
  remote host.

## Skill layout

A skill is a directory named after the skill:

```text
.mux/skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md
    references/
      ...
```

Skill directory names must match `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (1–64 chars).

## `SKILL.md` format

`SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---` on its own line.
Mux enforces a 1MB maximum file size for `SKILL.md`.

Required fields:

- `name`: must match the directory name
- `description`: short summary shown in mux’s skills index

Optional fields:

- `license`
- `compatibility`
- `metadata` (string key/value map)

Mux ignores unknown frontmatter keys (for example `allowed-tools`).

Example:

```md
---
name: my-skill
description: Build and validate a release branch.
license: MIT
metadata:
  owner: platform
---

# My Skill

1. Do the thing...
```

## Using skills in mux

Mux injects an `<agent-skills>` block into the system prompt listing the available skills.

To load a skill, the agent calls:

```ts
agent_skill_read({ name: "my-skill" });
```

If your skill references additional files (cheatsheets, templates, etc.), the agent can read them with:

```ts
agent_skill_read_file({ name: "my-skill", filePath: "references/template.md" });
```

`agent_skill_read_file` supports `offset` / `limit` (like `file_read`) and rejects absolute paths and `..` traversal.

<Info>
  `agent_skill_read_file` uses the same output limits as `file_read` (roughly 16KB per call,
  numbered lines). Files are limited to 1MB. Read large files in chunks with `offset`/`limit`.
</Info>

## Current limitations

- There is no `/skill` command or UI activation flow yet; skills are loaded on-demand via tools.
- `allowed-tools` is not enforced by mux (it is tolerated in frontmatter, but ignored).
