title: Forking Workspaces
description: Clone workspaces with conversation history to explore alternatives
---

Use `/fork` to clone a workspace with its full conversation history and UI state. The forked workspace gets a new workspace on a new branch (using the same backend as the current workspace).

Usage:

```
/fork <new-workspace-name>

[start-message (optional)]
```

## Use cases

- **Explore alternatives**: Fork mid-conversation to try a different implementation
  approach.
- **Isolate tangents**: See an unrelated bug or opportunity in the course of a change? Fork to keep the main conversation on track.
- **Create backup**: Fork to keep a copy of an old conversation before a risky change in direction.

## What happens when you fork

The new workspace:

- Appears at the top of the workspace list (most recent)
- Gets a unique auto-generated name (customize via rename after creation)
- Branches from the current workspace's HEAD commit

**What's copied**: Conversation history, model selection, thinking level, auto-retry setting, UI mode (plan/exec), chat input text

**What's not copied**: Uncommitted file changes (new branch starts from HEAD)
