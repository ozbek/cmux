title: Mux Governor
description: Our upcoming enterprise platform for Mux.
---

Mux Governor is an early access platform that enables teams and enterprises to
manage their fleet of Mux installations. It currently provides policy
enforcement tools to control runtimes, MCP, and provider access.

Policies can be written in JavaScript, with variables injected on a per-user
basis to allow for per-user policy variability. These policy scripts are
securely executed on the Mux Governor server.

### Deployment

Mux Governor is a self-hosted platform written in Go, similarly to our other
enterprise offering, [Coder](https://github.com/coder/coder). It is currently
not open source.

Please reach out to us if you're interested in trying Mux Governor.

### Policies

Currently, our policy document enables admins to control the following:

- Which providers a user can access (including proxy providers like
  `mux-gateway`)
- The base URL of each provider
- Which models a user can access on each provider
- Whether or not users can configure MCP via stdio or HTTP
- Which Mux runtimes the user can use to create workspaces

We have plans to expand the policy format to support more capabilities,
including:

- Tool control
- Budgeting
- Observability

### Client Usage

Currently, Mux Governor is an opt-in configuration on Mux clients. In the
future, we expect it will be enrolled to the Mux Governor via MDM.

To enroll a Mux client into Mux Governor, follow these steps:

1. Open **Settings** > **Experiments**, and enable the **Mux Governor**
   experiment.
2. Open **Settings** > **Governor**, and click **Enroll in Mux Governor**.
3. Enter the URL of your Mux Governor deployment, e.g.
   `https://governor.corp.com`.
4. Authorize Mux to access your account on Mux Governor in the popup window.
5. The Mux client should show a green shield badge and the rendered policy
   document. The policy is now in effect.

If you need to unenroll, you can go to **Settings** > **Governor**, and click
**Unenroll from Mux Governor**.
