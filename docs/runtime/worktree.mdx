title: Worktree Runtime
description: Isolated git worktree environments for parallel agent work
---

Worktree runtime uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) on your local machine. Worktrees share the `.git` directory with your main repository while maintaining independent working changes and checkout state.

## How Worktrees Work

A worktree is a separate directory on the same filesystem as the main repository that shares a `.git` but has independent working changes and checkout state. **All committed changes from any worktree are visible to all other worktrees including the main repository.**

It's important to note that a **worktree is not locked to a branch**. The agent can switch to new branches, enter a detached HEAD state, etc. When you create a workspace, the agent will begin at the selected branch but may switch freely in the course of the session. **We empower users to define their agent's branching strategy in AGENTS.md**

## Filesystem Layout

Worktree workspaces are stored in `~/.mux/src/<project-name>/<workspace-name>`.

Example layout:

```
~/.mux/src/
  mux-main/
    improved-auth-ux/
    fix-ci-flakes/
```
