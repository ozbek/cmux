title: Local Runtime
description: Run agents directly in your project directory
---

Local runtime runs the agent directly in your project directory—the same directory you use for development. There's no worktree isolation; the agent works in your actual working copy.

## When to Use

- Quick one-off tasks in your current working copy
- Reviewing agent work alongside your own uncommitted changes
- Projects where worktrees don't work well (e.g., some monorepos)

## Caveats

<Warning>
  **No isolation**: Multiple local workspaces for the same project see and modify the same files.
  Running them simultaneously can cause conflicts. mux shows a warning when another local workspace
  is actively streaming.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Affects your working copy**: Agent changes happen in your actual project directory.
</Warning>

## Filesystem

The workspace path is your project directory itself. No additional directories are created.
