## Downloads

### Release Builds

Download pre-built binaries from [the releases page](https://github.com/coder/mux/releases):

- **macOS**: Signed and notarized DMG (separate builds for Intel/Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: AppImage
- **Windows** _(alpha)_: Installer exe

### Development Builds

Download pre-built binaries of `main` from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/coder/mux/actions/workflows/pr.yml?query=event:push+branch:main):

- **macOS**: Signed and notarized DMG
  - `build-macos-x64` (Intel Macs)
  - `build-macos-arm64` (Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: `build-linux` AppImage (portable, works on most distros)
- **Windows**: `build-windows` installer exe

To download:

1. Go to the [PR workflow (main branch)](https://github.com/coder/mux/actions/workflows/pr.yml?query=event:push+branch:main)
2. Click on the latest successful run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download the appropriate artifact for your platform

### Installation

**macOS:**

1. Download the DMG file for your Mac:
   - Intel Mac: `macos-dmg-x64`
   - Apple Silicon: `macos-dmg-arm64`
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag Mux to Applications folder
4. Open the app normally

The app is code-signed and notarized by Apple, so it will open without security warnings.

**Linux:**

1. Download the AppImage file
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Mux-*.AppImage`
3. Run it: `./Mux-*.AppImage`

**Windows** _(alpha)_:

1. Download the installer exe from [releases](https://github.com/coder/mux/releases) (e.g., `mux-x.x.x-x64.exe`)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation prompts
4. Launch Mux from the Start menu or desktop shortcut

<Warning>
  Windows support is currently in alpha. Please [report any
  issues](https://github.com/coder/mux/issues) you encounter.
</Warning>

### Testing Pre-Release Builds

<Warning>
  Only builds from the `main` branch are signed and notarized. If you're testing a build from a pull
  request or other branch, you'll need to bypass macOS Gatekeeper:
</Warning>

1. After installing, open Terminal
2. Run: `xattr -cr /Applications/Mux.app`
3. Run: `codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Mux.app`
4. Now you can open the app normally

## CLI via npm

The mux CLI can also be run directly via `npx` without installing the desktop app:

```bash
# Run agent tasks
npx mux run "Fix the failing tests"

# Start the server for remote/mobile access
npx mux server --port 3000
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g mux
```

This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and scripted automation. See the [CLI documentation](/reference/cli) for all available commands and options.
