description: Configure authentication and session controls for mux server/browser mode
---

`mux server` can be accessed from browsers, mobile devices, and other machines on your network. This page covers how access control works, including the GitHub owner login allowlist.

## Authentication modes

By default, server access is protected by a bearer token.

Token resolution order:

1. `--no-auth` (disables auth entirely)
2. `--auth-token <token>`
3. `MUX_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`
4. Auto-generated token at startup

<Warning>
  `--no-auth` makes the server open to anyone who can reach it. Use only on trusted/private
  networks.
</Warning>

## Configure GitHub owner login

Mux can optionally allow GitHub Device Flow login for exactly one GitHub account.

Set the allowed account with either:

- Environment variable: `MUX_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_OWNER`
- Config file key: `serverAuthGithubOwner` in `~/.mux/config.json`

There is currently no UI control for this setting; configure it via env/config.

Example:

```json
{
  "serverAuthGithubOwner": "octocat"
}
```

If both are set, `MUX_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_OWNER` takes precedence.

When enabled, the auth modal shows **Login with GitHub**. Mux verifies the GitHub `login` value against the configured owner (case-insensitive). Non-matching users are rejected.

<Note>
  This allowlist currently supports a single GitHub username. It does not support multiple users or
  GitHub organization membership rules.
</Note>

## Server Access settings page

Open **Settings → Server Access** to manage browser sessions.

You can:

- Refresh active sessions
- Revoke a specific session
- Log out the current session
- Revoke all other sessions

This page manages cookie-backed browser sessions. Token-based access remains valid until you rotate/change the server token.

## Network exposure and bind settings

To expose Mux beyond localhost and configure bind host/port in the UI:

1. Open **Settings → Experiments**
2. Enable **Expose API server on LAN/VPN**
3. Configure bind host, port, and **Serve mux web UI**
4. Click **Apply**

Equivalent CLI options:

- `--host <host>`
- `--port <port>`
- `--ssh-host <host>`
- `--add-project <path>`
