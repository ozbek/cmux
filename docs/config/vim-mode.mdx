title: Vim Mode
description: Vim-style editing in the Mux chat input
---

Mux includes a built-in Vim mode for the chat input, providing familiar Vim-style editing for power users.

## Enabling Vim Mode

Vim mode is always enabled. Press **ESC** to enter normal mode from insert mode.

## Modes

### Insert Mode (Default)

- This is the default mode when typing in the chat input
- Type normally, all characters are inserted
- Press **ESC** or **Ctrl-[** to enter normal mode

### Normal Mode

- Command mode for navigation and editing
- Indicated by "NORMAL" text above the input
- Pending commands are shown (e.g., "NORMAL d" when delete is pending)
- Press **i**, **a**, **I**, **A**, **o**, or **O** to return to insert mode

### Visual Mode

- Visual selection mode for operating on highlighted text
- Enter with **v** (characterwise) or **V** (linewise)
- Motions extend the selection (e.g. **h/j/k/l**, **w/b/e**, **0/$**)
- Press **Esc** to exit visual mode back to normal mode (cursor returns to the start of the selection)

Supported operators in visual mode:

- **d** - Delete selection
- **c** - Change selection (delete and enter insert mode)
- **y** - Yank (copy) selection

Notes:

- Counts apply to motions (e.g. `v3w`)
- Operators act on the current selection (no extra motion required)

## Navigation

### Basic Movement

- **h** - Move left one character
- **j** - Move down one line
- **k** - Move up one line
- **l** - Move right one character

### Word Movement

- **w** - Move forward to start of next word
- **W** - Move forward to start of next WORD (whitespace-separated)
- **b** - Move backward to start of previous word
- **B** - Move backward to start of previous WORD
- **e** - Move to end of current/next word
- **E** - Move to end of current/next WORD

### Line Movement

- **0** - Move to beginning of line
- **\_** - Move to first non-whitespace character of line
- **$** - Move to end of line
- **Home** - Same as **0**
- **End** - Same as **$**
- **gg** - Go to first line
- **{count}gg** - Go to line {count} (1-indexed)
- **G** - Go to last line
- **{count}G** - Go to line {count} (1-indexed)

### Find/Till (Current Line)

- **f{char}** - Find next {char} on the current line
- **F{char}** - Find previous {char} on the current line
- **t{char}** - Move till before next {char} on the current line
- **T{char}** - Move till after previous {char} on the current line
- **;** - Repeat last **f**/**F**/**t**/**T** in the same direction
- **,** - Repeat last **f**/**F**/**t**/**T** in the opposite direction

Counts apply (e.g. **3fx** finds the third `x` on the line).

### Column Preservation

When moving up/down with **j**/**k**, the cursor attempts to stay in the same column position. If a line is shorter, the cursor moves to the end of that line, but will return to the original column on longer lines.

## Entering Insert Mode

- **i** - Insert at cursor
- **a** - Append after cursor
- **I** - Insert at beginning of line
- **A** - Append at end of line
- **o** - Open new line below and insert
- **O** - Open new line above and insert

## Editing Commands

### Simple Edits

- **x** - Delete character under cursor
- **p** - Paste after cursor
- **P** - Paste before cursor

### Undo/Redo

- **u** - Undo last change
- **Ctrl-r** - Redo

Notes:

- Insert-mode typing is grouped: `i ... Esc` becomes a single undo step.
- Undo/redo does not affect the yank register.

### Dot Repeat

- **.** - Repeat the last _structural_ edit at the current cursor position.

Limitations:

- Dot repeat does not replay arbitrary insert-mode typed text.
- Not every command is repeatable yet (for example, find/till-based edits like `dfx`).

### Line Operations

- **dd** - Delete line (yank to clipboard)
- **yy** - Yank (copy) line
- **cc** - Change line (delete and enter insert mode)

## Operators + Motions

Vim's power comes from combining operators with motions. All operators work with all motions:

### Operators

- **d** - Delete
- **c** - Change (delete and enter insert mode)
- **y** - Yank (copy)

### Motions

- **w** - To next word
- **b** - To previous word
- **e** - To end of word
- **W** - To next WORD (whitespace-separated)
- **B** - To previous WORD
- **E** - To end of WORD
- **$** - To end of line
- **0** - To beginning of line
- **\_** - To first non-whitespace character
- **f{char}** - Find next {char} on the current line
- **F{char}** - Find previous {char} on the current line
- **t{char}** - Move till before next {char} on the current line
- **T{char}** - Move till after previous {char} on the current line
- **;** - Repeat last **f**/**F**/**t**/**T** in the same direction
- **,** - Repeat last **f**/**F**/**t**/**T** in the opposite direction

### Examples

- **dw** - Delete to next word
- **dW** - Delete to next WORD
- **de** - Delete to end of word
- **d$** - Delete to end of line
- **dfx** - Delete through next `x` on the line
- **ctx** - Change till before next `x` on the line
- **cw** - Change to end of word (like **ce**)
- **ce** - Change to end of word
- **cW** - Change to end of WORD (like **cE**)
- **cE** - Change to end of WORD
- **c0** - Change to beginning of line
- **y$** - Yank to end of line
- **ye** - Yank to end of word
- **yy** - Yank line (doubled operator)

### Shortcuts

- **D** - Same as **d$** (delete to end of line)
- **C** - Same as **c$** (change to end of line)

## Count Prefixes

Many motions and commands support numeric count prefixes:

- **3w** - Move forward three words
- **20l** - Move right 20 characters
- **2dd** - Delete two lines
- **d3w** - Delete three words

### Parsing rules

- Digits **1–9** start a count.
- **0** appends only if a count is already in progress; otherwise it remains the **0** motion.
- Counts are capped at **10,000**.

### Supported commands (MVP)

Counts currently apply to:

- Motions: **h/j/k/l**, **w/W**, **b/B**, **e/E**, **0**, **$**, **\_**, **gg**, **G**, **f/F**, **t/T**, **;**, **,**
- Edits: **x**, **~**
- Operator + motion combos, including **dd/yy/cc**

### Limitations

Counts are not yet supported for every command (e.g. repeating paste, undo/redo, or insert-mode entry).

## Text Objects

Text objects let you operate on semantic units.

### Words

- **iw** - Inner word (word under cursor)
  - **diw** - Delete inner word
  - **ciw** - Change inner word
  - **yiw** - Yank inner word

- **aw** - A word (includes surrounding whitespace)
  - **daw** - Delete word + whitespace
  - **caw** - Change word + whitespace
  - **yaw** - Yank word + whitespace

Text objects work from anywhere within the word — you don't need to be at the start.

### Delimiters (current line only)

Quotes:

- **i"** / **a"** - Inside / around double quotes
- **i'** / **a'** - Inside / around single quotes

Brackets:

- **i(** / **a(** - Inside / around parentheses
- **i[** / **a[** - Inside / around square brackets
- **i\{** / **a\{** - Inside / around curly braces

Notes:

- These are currently **line-local** (they don’t search across lines).
- Escaping and complex nesting behavior is not yet supported.

## Visual Feedback

- **Cursor**: Thin blinking cursor in insert mode, solid block in normal/visual modes
- **Selection**: Visual mode uses the textarea selection highlight
- **Mode Indicator**: Shows current mode and pending commands (e.g., "NORMAL d" when waiting for motion)

## Keybind Conflicts

### ESC Key

ESC is used for:

1. Exiting Vim normal mode (highest priority)
2. NOT used for canceling edits (use **Ctrl-Q** instead)
3. NOT used for interrupting streams in Vim mode (use **Ctrl-C**)
4. In non-Vim mode, **Esc** interrupts streams

### Ctrl+C Key (Vim Mode)

In Vim mode, **Ctrl+C always interrupts streams** (similar to terminal interrupt behavior). This means:

- Standard Ctrl+C copy is **not available** in Vim mode
- Use **vim yank commands** (`y`, `yy`, `yiw`, etc.) to copy text instead
- This provides consistent interrupt behavior whether text is selected or not

## Tips

1. **Learn operators + motions**: Instead of memorizing every command, learn the operators (d, c, y) and motions (w, b, $, 0). They combine naturally.

2. **Use text objects**: `ciw` to change a word is more reliable than `cw` because it works from anywhere in the word.

3. **Column preservation**: When navigating up/down, your column position is preserved across lines of different lengths.

## Not Yet Implemented

Features that may be added in the future:

- **ge** - Backward end of word motion
- **More text objects** - Multi-line delimiters, escaping, and additional objects
- **Visual block mode (Ctrl-v)** - Blockwise selection
- **Macros** - Recording and replaying command sequences
- **Marks** - Named cursor positions
