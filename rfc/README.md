# RFC

This folder contains human-written but AI-assisted RFCs for implementing major work items in Mux.

It is an adjunct to AI planning but shifts content ownership to humans for more precise steering.

RFCs should be in files named `<YYYYMMDD>_<title>.md` in this folder.

The file should be structured as follows:

```markdown
---
author: @<github-username>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# <Title>

... body ...
```
