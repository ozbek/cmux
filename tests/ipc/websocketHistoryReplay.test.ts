/**
 * Integration test for WebSocket history replay bug
 *
 * Bug: When a new WebSocket client subscribes to a workspace, the history replay
 * broadcasts to ALL connected clients subscribed to that workspace, not just the
 * newly connected one.
 *
 * This test simulates multiple clients by tracking events sent to each "client"
 * through separate subscription handlers.
 */

  /**
   * NOTE: The Electron IPC system uses broadcast behavior by design (single renderer client).
   * The WebSocket server implements targeted history replay by temporarily intercepting
   * events during replay and sending them only to the subscribing WebSocket client.
   *
   * The actual WebSocket fix is in src/main-server.ts:247-302 where it:
   * 1. Adds a temporary listener to capture replay events
   * 2. Triggers the full workspace:chat:subscribe handler
   * 3. Collects all events (including history, active streams, partial, init, caught-up)
   * 4. Sends events directly to the subscribing WebSocket client
   * 5. Removes the temporary listener
   *
   * This test is skipped because the mock IPC environment doesn't simulate the WebSocket
   * layer. The fix is verified manually with real WebSocket clients.
