 * Runtime abstraction for executing tools in different environments.

 * DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Keep this interface minimal and low-level.
 * - Prefer streaming primitives over buffered APIs
 * - Implement shared helpers (utils/runtime/) that work across all runtimes
 * - Avoid duplicating helper logic in each runtime implementation
 *
 * This interface allows tools to run locally, in Docker containers, over SSH, etc.
