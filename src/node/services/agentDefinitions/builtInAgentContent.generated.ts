Your task is to write a concise summary of the conversation so far.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n- You have NO tools available. Do not attempt to call any tools or output JSON.\n- Simply write the summary as plain text prose.\n- Follow the user's instructions for what to include in the summary.\n",

Match plan complexity to the problem.\n- Keep the plan scannable; put long rationale in `<details>/<summary>` blocks.\n- When Plan Mode is requested, assume the user wants the actual completed plan; do not merely describe how you would devise one.\n\nDetailed plan mode instructions (plan file path, sub-agent delegation, propose_plan workflow) are provided separately.\n",
